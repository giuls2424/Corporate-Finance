This repository contains the code used for the Real Option Valuation of Novo Nordisk. All the drugs produced in pipeline are splitted into 4 categories: diabete care, obesity care, other rare disease and rare chronic disease. For each of them, the NPV and the corresponding strike price is used to estimate the option price using a Binomial Lattice model and the classical Black-Scholes model with its inputs.
